# 🏥 VERIQ  
## AI-Powered Hospital Operations & Decision Support System

VERIQ is an intelligent hospital management platform designed to **predict, prioritize, and explain** critical care decisions in **Emergency Rooms (ER)** and **Intensive Care Units (ICU)**.

Instead of reacting to overload, VERIQ enables hospitals to **anticipate patient deterioration, forecast ICU demand, and act early** using real-time data and machine learning.

---

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Hospitals face persistent operational challenges:

- Delayed triage due to manual assessment  
- Poor short-term visibility into ICU capacity  
- Inefficient patient prioritization during peak load  
- Reactive decision-making instead of proactive planning  
- Lack of explainability in AI-assisted decisions  

These issues directly impact patient outcomes and staff efficiency.

---

## 💡 Solution Overview

VERIQ addresses these gaps by providing:

- ML-based **patient deterioration risk prediction**
- Real-time **ER patient prioritization**
- **6-hour ICU bed occupancy forecasting**
- **Explainable AI** for clinical trust
- Data-driven **ICU admission and resource recommendations**

The system is designed to degrade gracefully if ML services are unavailable.
